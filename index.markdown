## About Me
I am currently a bioinformatician at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology where I work in the Peters Lab.
Professionally I am interested in all aspects of computational immunology, but more specifically T Cell Receptor biology, everything related to HLA, and RNA-Seq pipeline development. Outside of work you can find me playing old school RPGs, brewing beer, or enjoying a good book. (I personally recommend [The Stoic Philosophy of Seneca](https://www.amazon.com/Stoic-Philosophy-Seneca-Essays-Letters/dp/0393004597).)
## Projects
### ARC
ARC (antigen receptor classifier) is a Python module used to classify unknown protein sequences as immune related molecules (MHC, T Cell Receptor, Antibody). It accomplishes this task by using hidden markov models trained from IMGT data. ARC lives on the IEDB github [here](https://github.com/iedb/arc).
### HLAQuant
HLAQuant is a pipeline designed to quantify HLA allele specific expression from bulk RNA-Sequencing data. You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/acrinklaw/HLAQuant). HLAQuant is also available through PyPi.

## Publications

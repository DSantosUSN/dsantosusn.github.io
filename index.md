## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="headshot.jpg">

Hi! I am a Network Exploitation Analyst that recently has separated from the Navy. I served for 9 years and I'm looking forward to the opportunities in the Fort Meade, Maryland area. I have over 6 years of experience with CNE methodologies spanning across the NSA and USCYBERCOM. In my free time, I enjoy traveling, playing video games and drinking a beer over discord with my friends. If you need me, please see my socials.

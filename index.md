## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="headshot.jpeg">

I’m currently an Associate Scientist at 1859 inc. where I work on drug discovery. I have a passion for the intersection of software development and biology, particularly immunology. I’ve worked on a wide range of projects with quite a bit focused on T Cell Receptors and how we can analyze them. Outside of work I spend a lot of my free time playing video games, but I also enjoy building mechanical keyboards, brewing beer, and drinking said beer.

## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="headshot.jpg">

Hi! I am currently a Network Analyst/Instructor for NetSage in the Hanover, MD area. I have recently separated from the Navy after serving for 9 long years. 6 of which I gained invaluable experience with CNE methodologies spanning across the NSA and USCYBERCOM. The other three, I spent forward deployed in Yokosuka, Japan onboard the USS George Washington (CVN 73). In my free time, I enjoy traveling, playing video games and drinking a beer over discord with my friends. If you need me, please see my socials.
